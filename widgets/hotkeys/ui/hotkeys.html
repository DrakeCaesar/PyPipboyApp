		<h1>Hotkey Instructions</h1>
		<h2>Basics</h2>
			<p>This widget allows use hotkeys to trigger various in game actions. A small set of predefined hotkeys are included as defaults, which you can customise:</p><p>You can delete an existing hotkey by selecting it in the list, and then clicking the 'Delete Hotkey' button.</p><p>To create a new hotkey, fill in the fields below the table, and then click 'Add New Hotkey'.</p><p>To save your changes so that they are remembered when you next start PyPipBoyApp, click the 'Save Hotkeys' button.</p><p>If you've saved changes to the hotkey list and want to revert to the defaults, delete each of the hotkeys, click Save Hotkeys, and restart PyPipBoyApp.</p>
			<p>If you assign more than one action to the same hotkey, all of those actions will be triggered (in the order they were defined)</p>

			<dd><p>Use any item identified by name and the Inventory section in which to find it. The exact meaning of use depends on item: drugs\food will be consumed, weapons\armour will be equipped (or unequipped if already equipped).</p><p>Binding multiple instances of this command to a single hotkey can be used to switch between sets of armour, or take multiple aid items at once.</p><p>Note: as this works by matching the name of the item, it will stop working if an item is renamed (ie: when armour\weapons are modified).</p></dd>
